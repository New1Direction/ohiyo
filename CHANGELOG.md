# Changelog

All notable changes to Ohiyo are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
Ohiyo follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — though while
we're pre-1.0, minor releases can still carry breaking changes.

Making a user-facing or security-relevant change? Add a line under **[Unreleased]** in
the matching category — see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Voice pre-join roster:** voice channels now show who is already in the call before
  you join, including a live count and compact participant preview.
- **Call entry preview:** joining a non-empty voice room now opens a “Ready to join?”
  panel with occupants, Join, Join muted, and Cancel.
- **Privacy polish:** the sidebar now shows a Privacy Mode badge when metadata privacy
  is enabled; encrypted attachment previews/messages show trust labels; empty channels,
  empty DMs, onboarding link entry, and the command palette now guide users toward the
  next private action.

### Changed
- Voice state join/leave/mute/video metadata now reaches everyone who can access the
  channel so the sidebar updates live; WebRTC signaling and voice encryption keys remain
  restricted to actual call participants.
- The public download page now includes a Mac beta FAQ explaining the current
  non-notarized Gatekeeper warning and recommending the browser app for the smoothest
  first run today.

### Fixed
- Production call smoke tests now skip the dev-only low-level peer-connection inspector
  while still verifying the live roster/UI behavior.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-22

Two headline themes: **import your community from Discord**, and a top-to-bottom
**security & quality hardening** pass (three review-and-fix rounds, ~75 findings, all CI
gates green). Upgrading needs no data migration; the only opt-in change is signed file
URLs (off by default — see **Added**).

### Added
- **Import from Discord.** A guided wizard imports a Discord server from an exported
  archive (Discrawl) — drag-and-drop with an automatic preview and explicit safety
  labels — or a managed "clone" flow that installs a bot and lets you pick the server.
- **Multiple homes.** Switch between Ohiyo servers (your own self-host, an Instant
  Server, a friend's box) at runtime, each with its own session.
- **Signed file URLs** behind the `OHIYO_REQUIRE_SIGNED_FILES` flag — HMAC capability
  URLs for `/files/…`. Default **off**; see [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) before enabling it on
  an existing deployment.
- **"Log out everywhere"** (`POST /auth/logout-everywhere`) — instantly revokes every
  session for your account.
- **Listen-only voice** — join a call to listen without a microphone.
- A tabbed DM messenger strip.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Security
- **End-to-end group messaging:** sender-key messages now use a random per-message IV
  (carried in the envelope) instead of a deterministic one — closing an AES-GCM
  nonce-reuse window on concurrent / cross-tab sends. Existing messages still decrypt.
- **Encrypted message edits**, and a fix for a role-assignment privilege escalation.
- **Authorization:** closed cross-server / cross-channel access bugs (event RSVPs, poll
  votes) and access-checked the typing indicator, voice join/meta, and watch-party
  controls.
- **Sessions & passwords:** per-request token-version revocation (powers "log out
  everywhere"); new password hashes use Argon2id.
- **Secrets at rest (desktop):** the session token, the decrypted-message cache, and the
  unsent-message outbox are sealed in the encrypted vault instead of plain local
  storage; recovery backups no longer include the session token.
- **SSRF / traversal / XSS:** the link-preview fetcher pins resolved IPs (DNS-rebind
  safe); Discord-import file paths are confined; profile, social, and in-chat links are
  validated through a single safe-URL guard; the plugin sandbox neutralizes more globals
  and blocks CSS injection.
- **Supply chain & infrastructure:** dropped the unused MySQL backend from sqlx, removing
  the `rsa` crate (RUSTSEC-2023-0071) from the build; the server container runs as a
  non-root user; added a `Permissions-Policy` header and an inbound WebSocket frame-size
  cap; the gateway recovers from poisoned locks instead of aborting the process.

### Changed
- Screen-share is now the primary in-call stage, with a polished in-call layout.
- Settings, the custom-appearance editor, and the voice sidebar got a polish pass.
- Internal Fly machine/volume IDs are no longer returned in instance API responses.
- Database: added indexes on `dm_participants(user_id)` and `files(uploader_id)` for the
  DM-list and upload-quota hot paths.
- macOS desktop downloads now require a notarized build (unnotarized downloads paused).

### Fixed
- Voice: mic playback and speaking indicators, the listen-only badge, screen-share
  teardown re-entrancy, and double-join connection leaks.
- Reliability: duplicate-message de-duplication, single-flight outbox retries, and
  WebSocket dead-connection detection + reconnect.
- Accessibility: the settings dialog gained proper dialog semantics + a focus trap, and
  the speaking indicator honors reduced-motion.
- Error boundaries around the call, plugin, and watch-party surfaces — plus many smaller
  correctness fixes across the gateway, imports, and React effects.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-16

Release and CI plumbing to unblock multi-platform desktop builds.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-14

Initial public, self-hostable release: servers, channels, DMs, threads, reactions, and
read receipts; Signal-protocol end-to-end-encrypted DMs and group chats (multi-device,
disappearing messages, safety numbers); WebRTC voice / video / screen-share; a sandboxed
plugin system; the Daybreak and Dusk themes; and a Tauri desktop app.
